### Usage

1. Clone this repository locally.
2. `yarn init` to overwrite my infos with yours in _package.json_.
3. Change the remote repository with `git remote remove origin` (or you can delete the _.git_ folder).
4. Have a look at the various config files and see if defaults suit you.
5. Install development dependencies with `yarn`.
6. Make something cool in the _src_ folder. üèÑ‚Äç

###### Docker

If you don't have the urge to containerize, you can remove the Docker related files.
In case you do, `Dockerfile` is suited for production and `docker-compose.yml` for development.
